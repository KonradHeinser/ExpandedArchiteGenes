Expanded Biotech Style Genes(EBSG) is the step beyond [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2985153870]More Biotech Style Genes[/url]. Where that series sought to expand ranges that already exist, this series seeks to add ranges that should exist. You get gene ranges that alter sleep fall rate, but why not a range for changing the rate it recovers? If you can have fire resistance genes, why not have genes to resist other types of damage like frostbite and acid?

Expanded Archite Genes seeks to extend the purpose of archite genes beyond their normal "weird ability" state by adding 89 new genes to the normal ranges of genes. This mod goes through all of the ranges that [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2985153870]More Biotech Style Genes[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3020821838]Expanded Biotech Style Genes[/url] expand upon, and adds 3 new options in each range where I believed they fit. The genes are added based on the specific mods you have enabled, so if you only have specific individual mods, you will only see the archite genes related to those mods. 

The first archite level gene is approximately equal to the -4 metabolic efficiency gene in the same range, with some exceptions for standalone things like archite enhanced circadian ryhthm, and the occassional odd range, like beauty. These Archite genes will appear in the same area as the other genes in the range.

If you are using the individual mods instead of the All in Ones, these are the mods that have genes associated with them:
